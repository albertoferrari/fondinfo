title: Functions
figure: images/fun/function.png

- **`def`**, to define a function
- **`return`**, to (optionally) return the result
- Then, you **call** a function to execute it
- Type *annotations* for params and return value are optional and not verified

code: python

    def hypotenuse(leg1: float, leg2: float) -> float:
        hyp = (leg1 ** 2 + leg2 ** 2) ** 0.5
        return hyp

    result = hypotenuse(3, 4)  # 5.0

---

title: List
figure: images/fun/month-list.svg

- **Mutable** sequence of elements
- *Usually* of the same *type*
- Current *length* of a list `x`: `len(x)`
- Elements *enumerated* from `0` to `len(x)-1`

code: python

    months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
              "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]

code: python

    num_days = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30,
                31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]

code: python

    results_by_month = [0] * 12  # List repetition

---

title: Elements and slices
figure: images/fun/wile-coyote.png

- **Attention: use valid indices!**
    - But *negative* indices counts from the end

code: python

    n = len(months)            # 12
    months[3]                  # "Apr"
    months[-2]                 # "Nov", same as n - 2

    spring = months[2:5]       # ["Mar", "Apr", "May"]
    quart1 = months[:3]        # ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"]
    quart4 = months[-3:]       # ["Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
    whole_year = months[:]     # Copy of the whole list

---

title: Insertion and removal
figure: images/fun/shopping-list.png

code: python

    grocery = ["spam", "egg", "beans"]

    grocery[0] = "sausage"      # replace an element

    grocery.append("bacon")     # add an element to the end
    grocery.pop()               # remove (and return) last element

    grocery.insert(1, "bacon")  # other elements shift
    removed = grocery.pop(1)    # remove (and return) element at index

    if "egg" in grocery:       # True, grocery contains "egg"
        grocery.remove("egg")  # remove an element by value

---

title: Equality and identity

code: python

    a = ["spam", "egg", "beans"]
    b = a[:]         # new list!
    b == a           # True, they contain the same values
    b is a           # False, they are two objects in memory
                     # (try and modify one of them...)
    c = a
    c is a           # True, same object in memory
                     # (try and modify one of them...)

    d = ["sausage", "mushrooms"]
    grocery = c + d  # list concatenation --> new list!

---

title: Strings and lists

- **String**: *immutable* sequence of chars
- **`join`** and **`split`**: from list to string and viceversa

code: python

    txt = "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
    txt[3]    # 't'
    txt[-2]   # 'u'
    txt[6:12] # "Python"
    txt[-6:]  # "Circus"

    days = ["tue", "thu", "sat"]
    txt = "|".join(days)  # "tue|thu|sat"

    days = "mon|wed|fri".split("|")
    # ["mon", "wed", "fri"]

---

title: Tuple

- **Immutable** sequence of values, even of *different type*

code: python

    # Tuple packing
    pt = 5, 6, "red"
    pt[0]  # 5
    pt[1]  # 6
    pt[2]  # "red"

    # multiple assignments, from a tuple
    x, y, colour = pt  # sequence unpacking
    a, b = 3, 4
    a, b = b, a

---

title: Cycles on sequences: for

code: python

    grocery = ["spam", "egg", "bacon", "sausage"]
    for product in grocery:
        print(product)

code: python

    for val in range(0, 5):
        print(val * val, end=" ")  # 0 1 4 9 16

- At each iteration, a different element of `grocery` is assigned to `product`
- A `for` cycle can be used on any kind of sequence: list, string, tuple, range...
- **`range`**: range of consecutive values
    - Lower end *included* (defaults to 0)
    - Upper end *excluded*

---

title: Functions on lists

code: python

    def limit_values(values, max_val):
        # procedure: process data, no direct result
        for i in range(len(values)):
            if values[i] > max_val:
                values[i] = max_val

        # the pythonic way: for i, val in enumerate(values): ...

    def main ():
        data = [5, 4, 2]
        limit_values(data, 4)
        print(data)

    main()

---

title: List comprehension
figure: images/dev/computer-ninja.png

- Terse way to create a list
- Each element: result of an operation on a member of another iterable
- Condition on elements, optional

code: python

    squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(12)]
    # squares = []
    # for x in range(12):
    #    squares.append(x ** 2)

code: python

    even_nums = [str(x) for x in range(12) if (x % 2) == 0]

---

title: Enumerate
figure: images/repr/child-fingers.png

- To couple each value of a sequence to an increasing index
- It generates a sequence of tuples (pairs)
- In `for` cycles, using both value and index

code: python

    >>> grocery = ["spam", "egg", "bacon", "sausage"]
    >>> list(enumerate(grocery))
    [(0, "spam"), (1, "egg"), (2, "bacon"), (3, "sausage")]

code: python

    grocery = ["spam", "egg", "bacon", "sausage"]
    for i, val in enumerate(grocery):
        print(i, val)

>

Results in a list: only (!) to visualize them <br>
Otherwise, Python doesn't generate results immediately (*lazy*)

---

title: Zip
figure: images/fun/zip.png

- Couples elements of two sequences
- It generates a sequence of tuples (pairs)
- The result has the len of the shortest sequence

code: python

    >>> grocery = ["spam", "egg", "bacon", "sausage"]
    >>> quantities = ["100 g", "6 pc", "200 g", "500 g", "too much"]
    >>> list(zip(grocery, quantities))
    [("spam", "100 g"), ("egg", "6 pc"), ("bacon", "200 g"),
    ("sausage", "500 g")]

>

Results in a list: only (!) to visualize them

---

title: Map
figure: images/fun/legomap.png

- Takes a function and a sequence as params
- *Higher order function*
- Applies the function to each value
- Returns the sequence of results

code: python

    >>> from math import sqrt
    >>> values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> list(map(sqrt, values))
    [0.0, 1.0, 1.4142, 1.7320, 2.0]

code: python

    >>> from math import sqrt
    >>> list(map(sqrt, range(5)))
    [0.0, 1.0, 1.4142, 1.7320, 2.0]

>

Results in a list: only (!) to visualize them

---

title: Sort and reverse

code: python

    >>> grocery = ["spam", "egg", "bacon", "sausage"]
    >>> sorted(grocery)
    ['bacon', 'egg', 'sausage', 'spam']
    >>> sorted(grocery, reverse=True)
    ['spam', 'sausage', 'egg', 'bacon']
    >>> sorted(grocery, key=len)  # lengths of elements are compared
    ['egg', 'spam', 'bacon', 'sausage']

code: python

    >>> list(reversed(grocery))
    ['sausage', 'bacon', 'egg', 'spam']

code: python

    >>> grocery.sort()     # in-place
    >>> grocery.reverse()  # in-place
    >>> grocery
    ['spam', 'sausage', 'egg', 'bacon']

---

title: Dictionary
figure: images/fun/dictionary.png

- Sometimes called *map* or *associative array*
- Unordered set of key / value pairs
    - Keys are *unique*: like *indices* for lists, to access the associated value
    - They can be `int` or **`str`** (or any other immutable type)

code: python

    >>> tel = {"john": 4098, "terry": 4139}
    >>> tel["john"]
    4098
    >>> tel["graham"] = 4127
    >>> tel
    {"graham": 4127, "terry": 4139, "john": 4098}

>

Try also `list(tel)` and `list(tel.items())`

---

title: Multidim lists
- Lists of lists of ...
    - Access to elements: two or more indices (or *dimensions*)
    - If bidimensional, called *matrices*

code: python

    a = [['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
         ['E', 'F', 'G', 'H'],
         ['I', 'L', 'M', 'N']]          # 2D

    b = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D',
         'E', 'F', 'G', 'H',
         'I', 'L', 'M', 'N']            # 1D

    i = y * cols + x                    # 2D -> 1D

    y = i // cols
    x = i % cols                        # 1D -> 2D

        for y in range(rows):
            val = matrix[y][x]
            total += val
        print("Col #", x, "sums to", total)

    matrix = [2, 4, 3, 8,
              9, 3, 2, 7,
              5, 6, 9, 1]
    rows = 3  # Cannot be guessed from matrix alone
    cols = len(matrix) // rows

    for x in range(cols):
        total = 0
        for y in range(rows):
            val = matrix[y * cols + x]   # 2D -> 1D
            total += val
        print("Col #", x, "sums to", total)

---

title: Matrix with known size

code: python

    matrix = [[' ' for x in range(cols)] for y in range(rows)]
    # all elements are inited as ' ' -- your need may vary

code: python

    matrix = []

        for x in range(cols):
            new_row.append(' ')
        matrix.append(new_row)

---

title: Data streams
figure: images/fun/magnetic-tape.png

- **Stream**: abstraction for information stream
    - Reading and writing information on *any* I/O device (*file, and more*)
- **Text file**
    - Various encodings (*UTF-8*, or other)
    - Automatic conversions, e.g. `"\n"` → `"\r\n"`
- **Binary file**
    - Precise I/O, bytes are not converted
    - Any file... also a text file!

---

title: Writing on file

- `open` function to access a file (text, by default)
    - Write or read mode: `"w"`, o `"r"` (def.)
- Writing to file: `print` funtion, or `write` method
- `with` section: at the end the file is closed (also in case of error)

code: python

    with open("some_file.txt", "w") as f1:
        f1.write("First line\n")   # explicit newline
        f1.write("Second line\n")  # continue writing here...

    with open("other_file.txt", "w") as f2:
        for x in range(10):
            print(x, x ** 2, file=f2)

---

title: Reading from file

code: python

    with open("some_file.txt", "r") as f1:
        first_line = f1.readline()
        second_line = f1.readline()
        # both strings contain '\n' at the end
        # at end of file, an empty string is read

    with open("other_file.txt", "r") as f2:
        whole_text = f2.read()
        # do stg with whole_text

    with open("last_file.txt", "r") as f3:
        for line in f3:
            # line contains '\n' at the end
            # strip() removes withespaces at both ends
            print(line.strip(), ':', len(line))

title: Basic CSV files

code: Python

    matrix = []
    cols, rows = 0, 0

    with open('matrix.csv', 'r') as file1:
        for line in file1:
            splitted = line.split(',')
            vals = [int(i) for i in splitted]
            matrix.append(vals)
            ## matrix += vals  # for a simple list (ex. 4.5)

            if cols == 0:
                cols = len(vals)
            rows += 1

---

title: CSV module

code: Python

    import csv
    matrix = []
    with open('some.csv', newline='') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            matrix.append(row)
    print(matrix)

    with open('some.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        for row in matrix
            writer.writerow(row)

---

title: I/O for strings and console

- Strings as streams: `io.StringIO`
- Console as stream: `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`

code: python

    import io, sys

    with io.StringIO() as output:
        output.write("First line.\n")
        print("Second line.", file=output)
        # Retrieve stream contents, i.e. "First line.\nSecond line.\n"
        contents = output.getvalue()
        sys.stdout.write(contents)

code: python

    for line in sys.stdin:  # CTRL-D (Lin) or CTRL-Z (Win) to end the input
        print(len(line))    # notice '\n' at the end

---

title: Errors on file
figure: images/fun/garbled-tape.png

- **Exceptions**: to handle unexpected cases separately
    - Error inside `try`: esecution is interrupted immediately
    - `except` section is executed, to handle the specific type of error (multiple `except` sections are allowed)
    - A `with` section assures the file is closed

code: python

    try:
        with open("other_file.txt", "r") as f:
            whole_text = f.read()
            # do stg with whole_text
    except IOError as err:
        print("Oh, my!")

title: Lists in memory
class: large-image

![](images/scipy/python-list-list.svg)

---

title: Number crunching in Python

- Inefficient **memory** layout
    - Multiple *dereferencing* steps
    - Each value is a “*fat*” object, an `int` takes dozens of bytes
    - Values are *not contiguous*, not cache friendly
- `a + b` executed as:
    - `a.__add__(b)`, or...
    - `b.__radd__(a)`, if `__add__` not found
- Python is **dynamic**
    - *Monkey patching*
    - Any method, special or not, can be changed or *decorated* at any time
    - Lookup at each call

---

title: Method lookup

- In general, methods are handled as attributes
    - Complex lookup in multiple dictionaries
    - Starts with `a.__getattribute__("something")`
    - An *instance* has its own methods
    - A *class* has its own methods
    - A *base class* has its own methods
    - A *metaclass* may also alter the lookup
- “Special methods” are... *special*
    - Cannot be set for a single instance
    - Faster lookup
    - Still possibly going through multiple dictionaries

---

title: Virtual environments

- Standard Python provides *virtual environments*
- To install different modules for different projects
- Ex.: *create* `myenv` env., *activate* it, *install* some modules

code: Shell

    $ python3 -m venv myenv
    $ source myenv/bin/activate
    $ pip install numpy

- First command creates new folder, with a copy of CPython
- To change to another env, *deactivate* the current one
    - To delete an env, delete its folder
- On Windows, scripts are in the `Script` folder
    - `sci-env\Scripts\activate.bat`

---

title: Anaconda environments

code: Shell

    $ conda create --name myenv
    $ conda install -n myenv numpy

           [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
           [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
    >>> b.sum()  ## guess also min and max
    66
    >>> b.sum(axis=0)                            # sum of each column
    array([12, 15, 18, 21])
    >>>
    >>> b.min(axis=1)                            # min of each row

title: Concat and merge

- Take multiple pandas and put them together
- `concat()`: one piece below the other
- `merge()`: rows are joined when they have the same `key`

code: Python

    >>> left = pd.DataFrame({'key': ['foo', 'bar'], 'lval': [1, 2]})
    >>> right = pd.DataFrame({'key': ['foo', 'bar'], 'rval': [4, 5]})
    >>> pd.merge(left, right, on='key')
       key  lval  rval
    0  foo     1     4
    1  bar     2     5

title: Group-by

- Split data into groups based on some criteria
- Apply a function to each group independently
- Combine the results into a data structure

code: Python

    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A' : ['foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'bar',
                                  'foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'foo'],
                           'B' : ['one', 'one', 'two', 'three',
                                  'two', 'two', 'one', 'three'],
                           'C' : np.random.randn(8),
                           'D' : np.random.randn(8)})

title: Pivot table

- Reshape the dataframe, using values as new rows and columns titles

code: Python

    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A' : ['one', 'one', 'two', 'three'] * 3,
                           'B' : ['A', 'B', 'C'] * 4,
                           'C' : ['foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'bar', 'bar', 'bar'] * 2,
                           'D' : np.random.randn(12),
                           'E' : np.random.randn(12)})
